            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Proposal for a Subscription to Raise <hi>One Hundred Thousand Pounds,</hi> For Circulating the Credit of a Land-Bank.</head>
            <p>THIS short Experience, since the Bank of <hi>England</hi> has bee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> set up, has sufficiently discovered the great Advantage from it, to the Government and Trade, by Lowring the Interest on Tallies, Bills of Exchange, and Money on Goods, which seems the Business of the Bank.</p>
            <p>And on the contrary, the Prejudice from it to the Owners of Lands and Houses, doth as plainly appear; For the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of Money being so greatly turned into the Bank, has made it Difficult to Supply real Securities with Money; and hath thereby Raised the Interest upon them, and Sunk the Values of Lands.</p>
            <p>This ill Effect caused a general Clamour of the Landed Men of <hi>England;</hi> Which to Pacifie, An Order from the Directors of the Bank was published in the <hi>Gazett,</hi> That they would Lend Money on Land.</p>
            <div type="reasons">
               <head>The Reasons that might Divert them, so as to do Little in it, might probably be These:</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That the Directors being Merchants, and Traders, and not Acquainted with the Titles and Values of Land, might not be such proper Persons to deal in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Money Lent on Mortgages seems Difficult, and slow in Returning. And <hi>Lastly,</hi> The Profit seems Small.</p>
               <p>Upon the Consideration of the First, The Authors of the Settlement <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Land Bank, found it absolutely necessary, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat the Majority of the Governours should at the First Settlement be Lawyers, whose Study and Practice have made them more Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Titles and Values of Land.</p>
               <p>And therefore the Design of the Settlement is, That Ten Gentlemen of the Bar, that Subscribe, and pay down the Sum of Money in manner as hereafter is expressed, shall be Ten of the First Governours of the Bank.</p>
               <p>As to the two latter Reasons, That the Money lent on Land will be difficult and slow in Returning, and of small Profit; they must be answered by the methods in the Settlement and Experience thereupon to the contrary: By which it will appear, That Money lent on Land may be as easily and quickly Returned, as Money on Goods or Bills of Exchange. And as for the Profit of this Bank, if it be considered as Rent on Land, and that Twenty Shillings in Rent is equal to Twenty Pounds in Money; this 100000 <hi>l.</hi> Stock may perhaps at the Years end make up the Account of Profit equal to a much greater Sum in other Stocks.</p>
               <p>And besides the Profit, the Subscribers will hereby lessen the Interest of Money on Land, as much, if not more, than the Bank of <hi>England</hi> has done it on Bills of Exchange or Goods, and will raise the Value of all the Lands of <hi>England,</hi> and thereby pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve many Families of the Nobility and Gentry from Ruin.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="proposals">
               <head>The PROPOSALS are:</head>
               <p>THAT no Person Subscribe less than 100 <hi>l.</hi> nor more than 5000. of which 20 <hi>l. Per Cent.</hi> is to be paid down as soon as 30000 <hi>l.</hi> is Subscribed, and the Residue as the Governours of the Bank shall call for it; with a Rebate of Interest for the said 20 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> till the whole 100000 <hi>l.</hi> be Subscribed.</p>
               <p>That every Person that Subscribes, shall have One Vote in Choosing the Governours, and no Person more than Ten.</p>
               <p>That the Governours are to be One and Twenty, and chosen Yearly; and that every Person that Subscribes 1000 <hi>l.</hi> is capable of being Chosen one of the Governours.</p>
               <p>There are other particulars in the Settlement, too large here to Insert; and therefore for the satisfaction of those that shall Subscribe, the whole Settlement is Transcribed in the Subscription-Book for any Gentleman to Read, if he pleaseth, before he Subscribes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Subscription-Book lyes Open, at the Chamber over the</hi> Stamp-Office <hi>in</hi> Lincolns-Inn, <hi>and will continue there till the Subscriptions are Compleated.</hi>
